# RSDiagnostics - CustomsForge Tool

The purpose of this program is to provide an output for staff and other users to help diagnose problems with their **Rocksmith 2014 Remastered** install including but not limited to CDLC. Our goal is to also find other problems such as for example audio exclusivitiy being enabled when someone wants to do something else that requires that to be disabled. This would show the output of their settings so we can better direct them into what needs to be changed.
